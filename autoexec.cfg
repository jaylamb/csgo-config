snd_menumusic_volume "0" 	// (disables menu music)
snd_mix_async "1"   		// (allows for shorter lookahead buffer (snd_mixahead), improves performance)
snd_mixahead "0.025"   	// (low audio latency, makes CS audio feel more insync with screen)
snd_stream "1"   		// (new command. Streams audio from harddrive rather than your 				      RAM cache, will be set as default for all users in the future. 				      Can cause temporary stutters when used for the first time. 				      Reported to fix some FPS drop issues)

cl_lagcompensation "1"   	// (activates client-side lag compensation)
cl_predict "1"   		// (activates client-side prediction, predicts physics, movement, 				      firing etc)
cl_predictweapons "1"   	// (activates client-side weapon effects prediction)
cl_interp "0"   			// (interpolation, should always be set to "0")
cl_interp_ratio "1"   		// (interpolation ratio, recommended is "1")
cl_cmdrate "128"		// (for -tickrate 128 launch option)

cl_downloadfilter "nosounds"	// (stops servers from downloading annoying custom sounds)
cl_showhelp "0"   		// (disables ingame tips, similar to cl_autohelp)

cl_forcepreload "1"   		// (preloads map assets automatically when you enter a map 				      instead of loading it into memory when the map demands it, 				      improves FPS)   

r_dynamic "0"   		// (disables dynamic lightning effects which can be a 					      disadvantage, improves FPS slightly on lower spec PCs but I 				      recommend using "1" instead)

m_rawinput "1"   		// (enables raw hardware input for mouse, disables all software 				      filtering, acceleration, post-processing etc)
